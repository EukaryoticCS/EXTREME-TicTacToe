# EXTREME TicTacToe

## Description

Extreme TicTacToe is a console-based, multiplayer strategy game made in Java. It's like regular TicTacToe, but *better*.    
Long gone are the days of endless CATS games and simply hoping your opponent doesn't know simple TicTacToe strategy!

# How to Play

## Ultimate TicTacToe Rules:

Please read the "Rules" section in this Wikipedia page:

## The Controls

At the beginning of the game and at various points (explained in the rules), a player will have to choose which *local board* they want to play on. This is indicated by the entire board being highlighted red:

To do so, you will be prompted to input a row and then a column between 1 and 3 each. After picking the sub-board, you will choose which cell to play on. This is indicated by the local board in question being highlighted red:

Again, you will be prompted first for a row, then a column. All subsequent turns will follow this pattern of picking a cell, and the local board the next player plays in is already determined for you.    

## Winning the Game
Getting a "TicTacToe" (3 of your symbol in a row -- vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) in any local board will fill that board with your symbol. This indicates that you've "captured" that board. Once you get a TicTacToe on the global board, you win!
